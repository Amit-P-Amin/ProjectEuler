I first worked on Project Euler five months ago, completing 55 problems in preparation for App Academy. I didn't save my solutions, so on creating this repository I redid the first 21.

At first, I didn't mind redoing problems. What took me dozens of lines of code before, I was now able to do in one or two lines. Object oriented programming and Ruby enumerable methods are extremely powerful.

Then I got bored, so I moved on to new problems.
